In this example, we use Lightship Object detection to identify objects that fit the <i>category</i> selected.

Rectangles will be drawn surrounding objects in the camera that match the selected category.
You can also modify the confidence threshold to calibrate the detection.
Both the category dropdown selector and confidence threshold slider are in the settings menu.
